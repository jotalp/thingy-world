# Thingy.io

Thingy.io is a website for showcasing my tinkering projects. I will be using this platform to share my experiments with different technologies and showcase the outcomes of my tinkering.

## Technologies Used

I will be using various technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other front-end frameworks like React.js, Vue.js, etc. to build my projects. Additionally, I might also use back-end technologies like Node.js, Python, or PHP depending on the requirements of the project.

I will also be working with physical devices such as Raspberry Pi and Arduino boards and using them in my projects. For example, I might build a home automation system using a Raspberry Pi or create a weather station, an automated garden watering system using an Arduino board. I will also be using devices like Heltec Automation boards for my IoT projects as well. 

## Project Showcase

The website will have a dedicated section for showcasing all my tinkering. Each project will have its own page where I will have a list down the technologies used, and provide a demo if possible. Visitors can view the source code of each project on GitHub or any other relevant platform.

## Blog Section

Apart from showcasing my projects, I will also maintain a blog section on the website. Here, I will write about my experiences while working on different projects, provide tutorials on how to use certain technologies, and share my thoughts on various topics related to tinkering.

## Contact Me

In case anyone wants to get in touch with me regarding any of my projects or wants to collaborate on a project, they can reach me through the contact form available on the website.
